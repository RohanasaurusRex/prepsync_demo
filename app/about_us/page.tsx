        Meet the Team Behind Prep Sync AI

      <p className="text-lg leading-loose text-gray-700 mb-5 ml-7 mr-20 text-justify font-squada">
        We are Vivaan and Rohan, two passionate high school students; with a
        shared interest in both programming and business, we've combined our
        skills to create Prep Sync AI, a platform designed to help DECA
        participants excel in their role-play events.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-loose text-gray-700 mb-5 mx-7 text-justify font-squada">
        Our programming journey started with Python and Java, where we've
        developed a solid foundation in building applications and solving
        complex problems. Beyond coding, we are active members of our school's
        DECA chapter, where we've honed our business acumen and developed a deep
        appreciation for the challenges and opportunities that DECA competitions
        provide.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-loose text-gray-700 mb-5 mx-7 text-justify font-squada">
        Through Prep Sync AI, we aim to leverage our technical skills to give
        fellow DECA participants a powerful tool to practice and improve their
        performance. We believe in the power of preparation and are committed to
        helping others succeed in their DECA endeavors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-loose text-gray-700 mx-7 text-justify font-squada">
        Thank you for visiting our platform. We hope you find it as helpful and
        inspiring as we do!
